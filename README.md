Raspberry Pi Client for the Pill Dispenser Service

This repository contains the software that runs on the Raspberry Pi in the pill dispenser and is written in Python, and uses the Kivy framework.

The code for the software in the cloud and the web application [can be found in a separate repository](https://github.com/DirkWillem/0LAUK0-project)

If you would ever want to continue this project using this software, feel free to message me
